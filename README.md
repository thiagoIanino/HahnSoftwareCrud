# HahnSoftwareCrud initialization tutorial

- You can start the application using the docker-compose up command in the project's root path.
You will notice 3 different containers running. The API, Web application, and Mysql.

- You don't need previous configuration in the database, because the docker-compose will automatically run a SQL script to create the tables.

- When the application is running, you can access the Angular Web Application at http://localhost:8080/

- The CRUD functionalities will be available in the "Items" section on the side menu. 

Thanks :)
